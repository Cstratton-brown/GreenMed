ELEE-1149 Assignment 3rd Phase
This is the 3rd phase of my University assignment for Module ELEE-1149: Software Engineering.
The task is to create a gui for a GPs office that fits certain parameters.
The parameters are that only Receptionists can book patient appointments.
Doctors and Nurses can view their patient appointments for the day and the month.
Doctors and Nurses can see a database of repeat pescriptions but only the doctors can edit them.
